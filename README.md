# ANN-Customer-Churn
My goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn).  I ranked all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of leaving using the Deep Learning model which is based on probabilistic approach.
